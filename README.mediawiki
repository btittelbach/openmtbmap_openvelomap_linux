=== Usage ===

 Usage: create_omtb_garmin_img.sh <mtb*.exe|velo*.exe> <TYP-file or TYP-type> [path/to/mkgmap.jar]
       as TYP-type you can choose:
       clas: classic layout - optimized for Vista/Legend series
       thin: thinner tracks and pathes - optimized for Gpsmap60/76 series
       wide: high contrast layout, like classic but with white forest - optimized for Oregon/Colorado dull displays
       hike: like classic layout - but optimized for hiking (does not show mtb/bicycle informations)
       easy: similar to classic layout - but focussed on easy readability hence not showing mtb/bicycle information except routes
       velo: (comes with velomap files) Layout optimized for small GPS screen
       or give the path to your own .TYP style file
