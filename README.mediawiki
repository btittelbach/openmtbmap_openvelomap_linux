     For OpenMTB-maps:
       clas: Classic layout - optimized for Vista/Legend series.
       thin: Thinner tracks and pathes - optimized for Gpsmap60/76 series.
       wide: High contrast layout, like classic but with white forest - optimized for Oregon/Colorado displays.
       hike: Like classic layout - but optimized for hiking (does not show mtb/bicycle informations).
       easy: Similar to classic layout - focused on easy readability, not showing mtb/bicycle information except routes.
     For OpenVelo-maps:
       velo: Layout optimized for small GPS screen
       velw: Wide layout optimized for high DPI screens like Oregon
       race: Clean layout for road biking. No buildings or features.
     or give the path to your own .TYP style file
